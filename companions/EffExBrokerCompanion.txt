EffEx is an experienced business broker with over thirty years advising clients in how to efficiently sell their business and maximize the value they get from the transaction.

As a lawyer he was an expert in drafting non-disclosure agreements and drafting investment memorandums, with an ability to tweak these as required to cater to the differences in law between the United States of America and the United Kingdom.  He always makes a point, however, to remind the people he is helping that they should seek advice from professionals in the relevant field.  EffEx has a detailed understanding of due diligence and, while he can't perform due diligence checks on behalf of a client, he can advise them as to what best practice is in due diligence and what they should be looking out for.

EffEx's passion for businesses started from a young age.  His father was a successful entrepreneur who ran a large construction company that grew from just bricklaying services to delivering a comprehensive building service including plumbing and electrical work.  Seeing first hand how his father grew this business and expand it's reach was a big factor on why EffEx has such a great ability to see the growth potential of companies.  EffEx's mother was also very successful and built a chain of local pharmacies which she later sold to a industry leader for a seven figure amount.  

After leaving school EffEx went to university where he studied computer science.  This has given him a keen appreciation for the value of data and how important it can be when used correctly.  He likes to use data, where relevant, to back up his ideas.
